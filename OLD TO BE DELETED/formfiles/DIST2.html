Claims on account of weight are allowable only when all of the following conditions are met. (1) When the variation exceeds the following amounts: (a) for all shipments except bulk rail cars and trucks, one-half percent (½%) of the entire contents; (b) for bulk rail cars and trucks, one percent (1%) of the entire contents. (2) When made within ten (10) days of receipt at destination. (3) For bulk rail car shipments, when supported by certified railroad scale tickets. (4) When buyer proves to satisfaction of the seller that the container in question was emptied in it entirety.</p>
<p>2. Shipments shall not be diverted nor reconsigned except with consent of Seller.</p>
<p>3. Seller makes no warranty of any kind, express or implied, except that the goods shall be of processable quality; that is, of fair average quality in the trade and within the description herein. Any affirmation of fact or promise made by Seller shall not be deemed to create an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise; any description of the goods is for the sole purpose of identifying them and shall not be deemed to create an express warranty that the goods shall conform to such description; any sample or model is for illustrative purposes only and shall not be deemed to create an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the sample or model; and no affirmation, promise or description of sample or model shall be deemed to be part of the basis for the bargain.

SELLER GIVES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO DESCRIPTION, QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, PRODUCTIVENESS OR ANY OTHER MATTER OF ANY GOODS WHICH THE SELLER SHALL SUPPLY. SELLER SHALL IN NO WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PROPER USE AND SERVICE, AND THE BUYER HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS OF REFUSAL AND RETURN OF GOODS.

<p>All claims for damages to packaging, errors or shortages must be made by Buyer in writing within two days from the time the shipment is examined by Buyer, but not later than 30 days after the goods are delivered.

The remedies reserved to Seller by the terms and conditions of this Invoice shall be cumulative and in addition to all other or further remedies provided by law. No waiver by Seller of any breach, default or violation of any of the terms or conditions hereof shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach, default or violation of the same or other term or condition.</p>
<p>9. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing, the parties recognize and consent to the jurisdiction over them of the Courts of the State of New York, for all purposes hereunder.

<p>12. Fitting up charges. Fitting up charges to Buyer cover part of the necessary tools and fixtures required for the particular work. Such tools and fixtures remain Seller's sole property and are retained in Seller’s possession for use exclusively in filling orders for Buyer. There will be no additional charge for upkeep or replacement, but if, at any time, a period of two years has elapsed since the receipt of any order from Buyer requiring the use of such tools and fixtures, Seller may thereafter make any such use or disposition of such tools and fixtures as Seller desired, without any accounting to Buyer for such use or disposition of the proceeds thereof.</p>
<p>13. It is further understood and agreed between Buyer and Seller that if the material and/or equipment sold is manufactured especially for the Buyer and if suspended or terminated by the Buyer for any reason, Buyer will take delivery of and make payment for such material and/or equipment as has been completed and such as is in process on the date notice to the Seller of the suspension or termination is received from Buyer. If Buyer for any reason cannot or does not accept delivery of such material, buyer will make payment as though delivery has been made and Seller will store such material for Buyer’s account at Buyer's expense.</p>

<p>15. Technical advice. Upon buyers request, Seller shall furnish such technical advice as it has available in reference to the use of the goods sold. It is expressly understood that any technical advice furnished by Seller is provided without payment or other consideration. Moreover, since Seller is not controlling or supervising the subsequent manufacture, fabrication or installation of its products or their use after sale, Seller assumes no obligation or liability for the advice given or the results obtained, all such advice being given and accepted at Buyer’s risk.</p>
<p>16. These terms and conditions shall supersede any provisions, terms and conditions contained in any Purchase Order or other writing Buyer may give or receive and the rights of the parties shall be governed exclusively by the provisions, terms and conditions hereof. Seller makes no representations or warranties except such as are expressly contained herein.</p>
